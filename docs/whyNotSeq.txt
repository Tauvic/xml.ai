seq2seq is bandwidth limited. It will find it hard to transfer large
amounts of information through the fixed length encoder/decoder.

Node reorderings and transformations are easy to handle with a model which
respects hierarchy already.

GraphRNN do not respect ordering of node neighbors. XML does. We go by XML.
